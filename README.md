### Sample Go bindings for GTK.

This is only example of usage of the [glib package](https://github.com/ziutek/glib) to
build bindings for GTK. It isn't suitable for writing real applications. If you
need working GTK binding see [go-gtk](https://github.com/mattn/go-gtk) or fork
this project and write missing features.

See *examples* directory to find out what my approach is different from the
*go-gtk*.
